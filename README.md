# Multiple Disease Prediction System

This project is a web application built with Streamlit that allows users to predict the likelihood of having diabetes, heart disease, or Parkinson's disease using machine learning models.

## Models Used

- **Diabetes Prediction Model**
- **Heart Disease Prediction Model**
- **Parkinson's Disease Prediction Model**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/multiple-disease-prediction.git
    cd multiple-disease-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Place the pre-trained models (`diabetes_model.sav`, `heart_disease_model.sav`, `parkinsons_model.sav`) in the root directory of the project.

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
